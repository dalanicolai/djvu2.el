* djvu2.el
** Read and annotate djvu with Emacs
   
[[https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/djvu.html][The original djvu.el]] is a great package for annotating djvu files, but it only
offers basic functionality to show/read djvu files.[fn:its docstring mentions
that it relies on djview for that] The djvu.el in this package
extends the original djvu.el with the following functions, all heavily inspired
by the [[https://github.com/politza/pdf-tools][pdf-tools]] package:

- smooth scrolling [fn:Has been implemented in the original djvu.el in the meantime]
- show various types of annotations (as shown in [[Demo][the demo below]]) 
- simple (not asynchronous as in pdf-tools) djvu occur function (=djvu-occur=)
- show color inverted document, i.e. somewhat equivalent to pdf-tools its
  midnight-minor-mode (=djvu-invert=)

All extended functionality is implemented in a very basic straightforward way
and most of the code can be much improved/better integrated (you are welcome to
;), but everything works very fine.
  
*WARNING!!* You should use =C-x C-s= for saving annotations (before you close/save a
 file). Do not rely on the usual way to save files, you can easily end up with
 some invalid file.

** Install
   Install with quelpa using the follow lines
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (quelpa '(djvu :fetcher git :url "git@github.com:dalanicolai/djvu2.el.git"))
    (require 'djvu)
  #+end_src 

*** Spacemacs
   For Spacemacs there is a [[https://github.com/dalanicolai/djvu-layer][djvu layer]] available.
   
** Usage
   Instructions for usage are found in the preliminary comments in the djvu.el
   file itself. Keybindings can be looked up by typing =C-h m= when djvu-read-mode
   is active (i.e. when visiting a djvu-file).

** Demo

The annotations are somewhat customizable. It is quite straightforward to extend
the functionality with Emacs lisp.
