* djvu2.el
** Read and annotate djvu with Emacs
   
[[https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/djvu.html][djvu.el]] offers basic functionality to show/read djvu files. However it does not
include functions for smooth scrolling. djvu2.el implements functions for smooth
scrolling. Furthermore, djvu.el already includes features for annotating djvu
files but it relies on DjView to visualize them. djvu2.el extends djvu.el so
that visualizations are shown within Emacs. As shown in the demo below:

*WARNING!!* You should use =C-x C-s= for saving annotations (before you close/save a
 file). Do not rely on the usual way to save files, you can easily end up with
 some invalid file.
 
** Install
   Install with quelpa using the follow lines
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (quelpa '(djvu :fetcher git :url "git@github.com:dalanicolai/djvu2.el.git"))
    (require 'djvu)
  #+end_src 

*** Spacemacs
   For Spacemacs there is a [[https://github.com/dalanicolai/djvu-layer][djvu layer]] available.

The annotations are somewhat customizable. It is quite straightforward to extend
the functionality with Emacs lisp.
